## Abstract

As she has grown older, my grandmother has experienced dizziness and infrequent fainting spells.
She has a button that she wears around her neck that she can use to call for help in case of a fall,
but it is risky to rely on her ability to press it during an emergency. Just recently, after I had
already began my research, she fainted while walking around her house and was injured from the
fall. As she was recovering we discovered she was showing early signs of dementia. Ever since then
a family member has stayed with her to make sure she is safe. This has been difficult for both my
grandmother and for the rest of her family who love her and want to care for her in the best way
possible.

This project looks into the potential for an artificial intelligence to monitor a person's activity and
be able to report any concerning behavior. Such an AI could give people like my father and aunt
the ability to better care for their loved ones. At the same time it will hopefully allow for people
like my grandmother to have a better sense of independence.

The goal of this project and report is to develop an artificial intelligence algorithm that can be
given a data point and accurately decide if a subject is standing in a room or if they are safely
sitting or laying down. I explore the development of such an algorithm and discuss why certain
actions are performed and how optimization decisions are made.
